*Everything that is mentioned here has high priority.
  The higher priority is specifically files that show connections between database and interface using php.
  Anything else can be ignored unless curiosity gets the better of you.
  Just know the files or code may not be documented well so take what you can from them.
  The tools I used are Microsoft Visual Studio Code and XAMPP.
  XAMPP is mainly used for the database part because it uses MariaDB.
  I personally would recommend XAMPP because it is sort of straightforward,
  and because of how popular it is used, there are a decent amount of resources, forums, etc.
  Unfortunately, I cannot figure out how to host the site properly at the time I typed this so the github pages will be a deadend if you click on it.

*All files that should be immediately seen/ not in any special folder:

  project_login.php
  
  project_signup.php
  
  project_user.php
  
  logout.php
  
  project_category.php
  
  project_guild.php
  
  (anything like ring, sword, etc.).php //all these files follow the same template of showcasing items on a page.

*Special Folders/files within the folders:

  templates/item_info.php

  sql_code/project_schema.txt

  login/connection.php
  
  login/functions.php
  
*Video resource (may help or may not)
